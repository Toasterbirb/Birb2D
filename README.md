# Birb2D
![Test workflow](https://github.com/toasterbirb/birb2d/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg)

Birb2D is a small and delicate 2D game engine made as a learning project.

Birb2D is not meant to be *production* quality, but there's a chance it can be used to make some games. Expect segfaults and all that usual stuff that come with newbie hobbyist C++ projects. If anyone ever picks this thing up and actually does something with it, definitely send it [my](https://github.com/Toasterbirb) way. I'd love to see it happen. Also any ideas or suggestions are welcome. Just know the scope, I'm not remaking Unity or Unreal Engine.

## Projects made with Birb2D

- [LD50.exe (Ludum Dare game)](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/ld50-exe)

## External libraries

- SDL2_ttf
- SDL2_mixer
- SDL2_gfx
- [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) (included as a headerfile)

## Building
Refer to [this](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/Birb2D/wiki/Setup) wiki page

## What works so far
Birb2D can already do something. You can draw pictures, polygons and other shapes and check for collisions etc. Also sound, buttons, a basic scene system and some basic math stuff is there. Physics engine is still completely missing. Also the documentation is quite lacking

## Note to Windows users
Could work, **not supported**. You might want to edit the enviromental variable usage and filepaths to fit Windows, but no guarantees are given.
